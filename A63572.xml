            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>The preaching of the Croſſe of Chriſt is eſteemed fooliſhneſſe in the judgment of the fleſh. For what can ſeem more fooliſh then to look for eternall life from a man, a dying man, a man crucifyed among Theeves, a man (as his adverſaries judge) not able to ſave himſelf from temporall death, and

                     <hi>come down off the Croſſe, and we will beleeve in him.</hi> It ſeemes a fooliſh thing for an unarmed Miniſter in a Pulpit to lay down laws for Princes and for people, to preſcribe the way to heaven, who hath no ſword to compel them to obedience, that come to hear him, but is ſubject to their ſury if they do reſiſt him. Neither is it ſtrange that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are counted fools, where God himſelf that imployes them, is accuſed of fooliſhneſs. Yet the comfort is, that <hi>The fooliſhneſs of God is wiſer then men.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">V. 25.</note> That is to ſay, where God ſhews leaſt wiſdome in any of his works (for God forbid any ſhould blaſphemouſly imagin any folly to be in God) in thoſe very actions he ſhews more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, then the wiſeſt men do in the choiſeft of all their works. The leaſt Flie doth more commend the wiſdome of the Maker, then the moſt curious picture of the greateſt Elephant. But if ye deſire a choiſe pattern, take Gods choiſe for a pattern; there ye have it. The world eſteems them fools whom God hath called, but Gods wiſdome appeared more in the choiſe of theſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55313:10"/>fools, then if he had choſen the wiſeſt of the world. For by this means the glory of his choiſe is not eclipſed, but ſhines through all the world unto the infinite and eternall praiſe of God.

Thus when we with the Peacock ſpread our feathers, the Apoſtle gives us juſt cauſe to look down to our black feet. The wiſeſt are but fleſh as well as the fooliſheſt of the ſons of men: the greateſt as well as the weakeſt: the nobleſt as well as the baſeſt. Thus the Prophet puls down that confidence which the <hi>Jewes</hi> put in the horſes of <hi>Egypt; Their horſes are fleſh and not ſpirit.</hi>

                     <p>And firſt for the proof of it.
<note n="1" place="margin">Proof of Spiritual kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.</note> This new affinity is proved many wayes. We have the ſame Mother: and who knows not that they that come out of the ſame wombe are Brethren? The Church of God is the Mother of us all, a better Mother then the ancient <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem:</hi> ſo the Apoſtle tels us,
<note place="margin">Gal. 4.26.</note> 
                        <hi>Jeruſalem which is above is free, which is the Mother of us all.</hi> As we have the ſame Church for our Mother, ſo have we the ſame God for our Father:
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.3.</note> 
                        <hi>God hath begotten us againe unto a lively hope.</hi> So that we are not half Brothers by the Mothers ſide alone, but Brethren in the ſtricteſt ſort, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſame Father, and the ſame Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Our diet and allowance prove us to be Brethren, we all ſit at our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers table; as <hi>Joſephs</hi> brethren did at his, <hi>They ſat before him,
<note place="margin">Gen. 43.33.</note> the firſt born ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his birthright, and the youngeſt according to his youth.</hi> Servants uſe to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend at their Maſters table, children are admitted to ſit down. So is it with us, God diſpoſeth of us as of Brethren among our ſelves, and children to him. He gives us the ſame ſpirituall food in the Word and Sacraments. Laſtly, the portion that we have in our Fathers poſſeſſions ſhews us to be Brethren. It
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55313:21"/>fares with us, not as with Country Gentlemen, whoſe Lands goe to their eldeſt Sons, and the reſt are left poor enough, though they be children of the ſame Parents. But we are uſed like the children of Citizens, who all have a ſhare of their Fathers goods. Our te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure is the freeſt tenure: not like thoſe that were brought in by the Conquerour, but rather anſwerable to the titles that men had in <hi>England,</hi> before the Conqueſt; or that which yet they uſe in <hi>Kent;</hi>

<note place="margin">Rom. 8.12, 16, 17.</note> Thus is the kindred proved. Let us now proceed to the Originall of it.</p>
                     <p>This fraternity hath a fourfold be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.
<note n="2" place="margin">Originall.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. In regard of God our Father. Look what title we have to be the Sons of God, the ſame title makes us Brethren. Now we are Gods children by a double right.</p>
                     <p>The one is by regeneration; God
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55313:21"/>hath renewed his image in us.
<note place="margin">Col. 3.10.</note> And as <hi>Adam</hi> was the Son of God at firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God had marked him for his own, and ſtamped his image on him: ſo are we made to be Gods own when he renews his image in us. Then do we <hi>put on the new man which after God is created in righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 4.24.</note> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving put on this image of God, God takes us for his own.</p>
                     <p>The other right is by adoption, God chuſeth us for his own:
<note place="margin">Gal. 4.5.</note> God ſent his Son, <hi>that we might receive the adoption of ſons.</hi> We were unworthy ſervants,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Digne fratres habentur qui unum patrem Deum agnove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt, qui unum ſpiritum bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berunt ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis, qui de uno utero ignorantiae ejuſdem ad unam lucem ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piraverunt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatis.</hi> Tert. Apol. c. 39.</note> nay which is more, we were perverſe enemies; but now we are the adopted ſons of God. Rich men uſe to take the children of poor men for their own, and to beſtow an inheritance on them, whoſe parents can leave them none: So God chuſeth us that by nature have no inheritance to expect but his wrath, and makes us his children and the heirs of glory. As children begotten by the ſame parents are counted Brethren, ſo are they that are adopted by the ſame parties.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In regard of our ſelves we are the children of God by faith, and ſo Brethren by conſequence among our

<note place="margin">Joh. 1.12.</note> 
                        <hi>As many as received Chriſt, to them gave he power to become the Sons of God, even to them that beleeve on his name.</hi> For faith puts us into Chriſt, it knits and unites us to him, and through him it makes us Gods children and brethren one to another.

Whereby we are to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from Jewes, Turkes and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels.</p>

                     <p n="4">4. We are compleatly Brethren in regard of other members of the Church, when we are firſt admitted to the Lords table. It is true that children baptized are our brethren, becauſe they belong to Gods covenant, yet they are in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree below ſuch as are admitted to the Lords table; as a child that ſucks, though he be a brother, yet doth not enjoy the comfort of his being ſo, till he come to the uſe of reaſon. The Lords Supper at leaſt declares us to be Brethren one to another, if it do not make us to be ſo. Hence it is called a Communion, becauſe there all true beleevers do truly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate of the body and bloud of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>The extent of our Spirituall kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred offers it ſelf next to our conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
<note n="3" place="margin">Extent.</note> It doth not extend it ſelf to matrimonall caſes. Spirituall kindred is no impediment to marriage. They are the <hi>kindred of our fleſh</hi> that no man muſt come near by the Law of God.
<note place="margin">Levit. 18.6.</note> There is a queſtion among the Papiſts, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpirituall kindred be an impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to marriage; that is, whether God-fathers, god-mothers, and their god-children may be married one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. If ſuch perſons may not marry
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55313:23"/>becauſe of that ſpirituall kindred that is between them; then Chriſtians muſt all marry Heathen wives, for they are all of this ſpirituall kindred, all Brothers and Siſters in Chriſt. So then, ſpirituall kindred doth not hinder marriage, nay it furthers it, for we are commanded to marry <hi>only in the Lord.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cor. 7 39.</note> The nearer the kindred of the fleſh is, the more unlawfull is the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: the nearer the ſpirituall frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is, the marriage is the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable. Moreover, this ſpirituall affinity extends not it ſelf to heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary caſes: if a Brother dye without children, his brother requires his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance as heir at the common Law. But it is not ſo in this fraternity of the Spirit. One cannot expect anothers inheritance: it muſt goe to the heirs according to the fleſh. So much our Bleſſed Saviour teacheth us, when he ſhews, that his Kingdome is not of this world, and though men look for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or wealth from the favour or kindred of Princes, yet it muſt not be ſo with us.
<note place="margin">Mat. 20.26. Luk. 12.13, 14.</note> Our ſpirituall kindred af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords us no ſuch priviledge. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt himſelf, the top of this kindred, would not divide inheritances
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:55313:23"/>between brethren, but left it as a work for worldly Judges. Spirituall kindred then hath nothing to do with temporal inheritances.

<note place="margin">Rom. 11.13.</note> both of the wiſdome and knowledge of God! how unſearcheable are his judgments and his wayes paſt finding out!</hi> Gods wiſdome doth infinitely exceed ours. There is a greater diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>protion between them, then between a fountain that never dryes up, and a ſtanding pool whoſe waters are dryed up by the heat of Summer, and fail when there is moſt need of them. The wiſeſt men have need of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailes of others, and therefore Kings have their privy Councels. One mans head, though it were <hi>Solomons</hi> could not reach to all occurrents of State: If it could, yet muſt it have much time to plot and to conſider which is the beſt way to bring things to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55313:29"/>paſſe. Angels themſelves doubtleſſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh not Gods will without ſome kinde of meditations. But Gods wiſdome goes beyond Men and Angels. He needs no counſaile of others to direct him, nor no meditations of his own to fiſh one thing out of another. His wiſdome is alwayes ready. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can happen ſo difficult, but he knows what to do without coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſail or ſtudy. For he knew before what would be done, and had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined what he would bring out of it. Look now upon a wiſe man, and ſee what difference is between his wayes, and the wayes of a fool: He tunrnes and winds the fool which way he pleaſe. He overrules him in his own actions. What the fool intends for his own credit, he turnes to his diſcredit. Yet he knows not certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what the fool intends. Only out of his wiſdome he gueſſeth by words and geſtures. No marvell then if God who knows all our purpoſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we know them our ſelves, can turn our actions to other ends then we entend, nay to contrary ones. For as his wiſdome and ours, ſo his wayes and ours have an infinite diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:55313:30"/>and are further diſtant then the higheſt heaven from the center of the earth. Gods power alſo goes far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond ours. Men may be potent: God is omnipotent. Their power is but weakneſſe compared unto his. God doth what he will: Men do what they can. When they have done what they can, God goes on with the work. He begins where they end, and turnes all to a new end which they never drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of. He ſubverteth the wayes of men by his power when he pleaſe: but all the world cannot hinder him in his purpoſes. The greateſt power that men have, is but a rivulet let out of the Ocean of Gods omnipotency. How often hath he clean altered the courſe of things? How often hath he croſſed the undaunted expectations of the proudeſt of the ſons of men? He hath ſent deliverance when naturall reaſon hath ſet nothing but deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before mens eyes. He hath defeated proud Tyrants, who in their own hopes and hearts have undoubtedly eaten up, and ſwallowed down his people like bread. Thus doth God as it were play with the great affaires of the world. He brings light out of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55313:30"/>darkneſſe; darkneſſe out of light. He raiſeth ſuch as think themſelves ruined, and ruins them that think themſelves firmly rooted. Our ends are reeds: he ſhakes them when he pleaſe. His ends are cedars: we cannot reach to the top, nor dive to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of them. His power and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome do conſpire to ſhew ſtrong men their weakneſs, and wiſe men their folly by chocking their actions in the blade. Gods wayes differ from ours, becauſe they are ſecret, and unknown unto us. He gives his Commandements to men, but reveals not his ends and purpoſes to them. His revealed will we have in his word to direct us; his ſecret purpoſe concerning the event of all things he locks up in heaven, and keeps the key himſelf. Men that uſe the counſaile of others, are often diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of their ends, becauſe their plots are revealed by them whoſe heads they were forced to make uſe of. But no man knows Gods ends, that he may reveal them. He knows ours, and can diſappoint them. We know not his, and therefore muſt ſubmit unto them: for we cannot (if we would) prevent them. A Mine may
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:55313:31"/>be prevented by a Countermine, if it be known or ſuſpected. Otherwiſe no man knows how to work under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground to diſappoint it. Gods works are like Mines. No man knows where he works, what he intends, nor how to croſſe it. Yet he knows how to countermine the ſecreteſt of our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, becauſe all things are open to him.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, the event in all Gods actions, anſwers to the intent. He ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was, nor can be diſappointed. It is far otherwiſe with us. Other things ariſe out of our actions then we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. Many evill things and croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes happen which we could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent: many good things betide us which we could not expect, becauſe the ſucceſſe of our actions is unknown unto us. We judge of the ſucceſſe of our courſes by likelihoods, God only knows certainly what will be the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. We deal altogether by gueſſes, God proceeds out of a certain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. No wonder then if his wayes be contrary to ours, and his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailes do exceed ours, to the diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing of our hopes, and the curing of our fears.

Hence it comes to paſſe that this ſpirituall honour is ſlighted. This is the cauſe why the means of ſalvation is neglected; becauſe men never look into the worth of our vocation. Yet in the mean while worldly ſtudies are embraced: all means of gain and new projects, are attended. Yea ſuch as often end in loſſe, are embraced in hope of gaine, becauſe men enriouſly pry into every hole where worldly profit may hide

<note n="1" place="margin">Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> it breeds thankfulneſſe to God that hath preferd them. As for generall favours that are common to us and others, they do not ſo much affect us, much leſſe make us thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to God, as thoſe peculiar mercies
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:55313:36"/>which are proper to us, and which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have no ſhare in. Thus the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of our own particular baſeneſſe, firſt affects us with joy, and then ſtirs us up to thankfulneſſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God.</p>
                     <p>Secondly,
<note n="2" place="margin">Admiration of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> it breeds admiration of Gods providence in us, who <hi>raiſeth up the poor out of the duſt, and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill;
<note place="margin">Pſal. 113.7, 8.</note> that he may ſet him with Princes; even with the Princes of his people.</hi> The changes that are wrought in others, do not commend Gods providence to our cogitations, ſo much as thoſe that are wrought in our ſelves. Gods providence then, which though it work many ſtrange things for others, and it may be more ſtrange then it works for us, is ſligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and neglected by us, by calling to minde our former lowneſſe is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wondered at by us and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly,
<note n="3" place="margin">Patience.</note> it brings forth patience in all adverſities, that can happen unto us. There can nothing happen to ſuch as are exalted from a low to an high eſtate, but the ſame or the like they have had experience of before. If poverty fall upon them, they have
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:55313:37"/>been poor before. If want trouble them, they have been in want before. Experience makes a man better able to bear any calamity. Theſe things may be ſtrange to ſuch as never knew what want meant: that were nobly borne and richly provided for by their parents. But to him that hath been in a Sea of wants and tempeſts of troubles before, though he have had a calme of plenty between, theſe ſecond ſtormes are far more portable then to the other freſhwater Souldiers.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly,
<note n="4" place="margin">Sobriety.</note> it produceth ſobriety in them. They have learned by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, what it is to want fleſh and food, and apparell, and other comforts; and therefore will not abuſe Gods gifts and bleſſings, leſt God take them away, and reduce them to their former neceſſities.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly,
<note n="5" place="margin">Humility.</note> it makes them humble to remember how low they have been before either in their ſpiritual or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral condition.

Sometimes the ſhame of the world affrights them, becauſe they want means to hide their offences. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the execution of good laws drives them from evill. But rich men know how to prevent all theſe means of reclaiming. They can for coyne make other men father their Baſtards, and ſtop the wheel of execution, that good laws may not bruiſe them. The threatnings of Gods law that breake poor mens hearts, do but harden rich mens; as the ſun-beams which ſoften the wax do nevertheleſſe make the clay harder. We threaten death, and they live. We threaten poverty, and they are rich. We threaten want, and they abound. Long enough may we threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ere they amend.

                     <p>Now for men of middle condition that are neither ſo rich as to give much, nor ſo poor as to aske, but have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient portion to bring them through the world; Here is for them:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. A leſſon of Thankfulneſſe to God, who hath placed them in the ſafeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in the world. Let them look down upon poorer men, and behold the manifold wants which thoſe poor ſouls and pined bodies dayly do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure: They want apparell and fire in the Winter, meat and drink in the Summer, houſes to dwell in, beds to lie on, and what not? All which men of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:55313:48"/>middle rank enjoy. Then let them look up ward, and number, if they can, the manifold cares that attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on rich men in the world. They are affraid of all men, friends and foes, acquaintance and ſtrangers, yea of wives and children, leſt they ſhould embeazle their eſtate, or diminiſh their treaſures. Their loſſes fetch more tears from their eyes, then their wealth brings ſmiles into their faces. All which fears and griefes men of middle condition are free from and exempted. Then let them lift up their heart with their hands unto God that hath freed them from the rich mans cares and fears on earth, and from his ſighs and grones in hell: And yet hath exempted them from <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> tears on earth,
<note place="margin">Luk. 16.</note> and will give them of his joyes in heaven, if they ſerve him faithfully in their genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Let them not henceforth praiſe the rich mans plenty: let them rather extoll their own ſecurity.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Let them reſt contented and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly ſatisfyed with their own condition. As they have not the tide of the world flowing in abundantly upon them, ſo they have not the winds of penury blowing ſtiffely againſt them.
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:55313:49"/>Their journey requires more labour in rowing, yet they paſſe with leſſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. While poor men are bewailing their wants to ſuch as are images ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then men, that know not how to pity them; and rich men are num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring their Cattell, viewing their Lands, telling their Coyne: they may with quietneſſe worke in their ſhops, or ſtudy in their cloſets, and often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween while commend themſelves and their labours to Gods benediction. There is no happyer ſtate on earth for them to envy. If they will aſpire, let them in their meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons mount up into heaven, where they may injoy felicity with eternity.</p>
                     <p>The greateſt part of my perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are yet to come, for I have yet to do with the greateſt men. What Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick ſhall I uſe to perſwade theſe men? Shall I tell them that Bees have ſtings as well as honey? That riches have diſcommodities as well as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities? How carefull and cautelous had they need to be in the uſe of them, that they may not exclude them from greater riches?

                     <p>The ſumme is, that rich men are not wholly excluded from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven.

Where for <hi>David</hi> a man after Gods own heart? All theſe were rich in this world, yet never any good man queſtioned their happineſſe in a better world. God is no accepter of perſons. All men naturally pity the poor, whether their cauſe be right <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>or wrong; and condemn the rich ere
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:55313:54"/>their cauſe be diſcuſſed. God doth not ſo. His commiſeration is not ſo great as to ſave all the poor: nor his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity ſo great as to condemn all the rich. Though he be a friend to the poor, yet is he not an enemy to the rich. Though the poor more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly finde his ear open, yet is he not hard to be entreated by the rich and wealthy. It were the way to make rich men deſpaire, if God had rejected them. Who ſhould receive them to favour whom God had refuſed? Who can make them happy, whom God had devoted to eternall miſery? Without Gods favour there is no ſalvation. It is a hard thing for rich men to be ſaved, yet is it poſſible to God. It were the way to make poor men to inſult, and almeſmen ingratefully to deſpiſe their benefactous, and to trample their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons under feet, by whoſe purſes they are maintained.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, it might be a means to bring Gods good gifts and temporall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings into contempt: and to make men caſt away their goods, that they might not damn their ſouls. Who would keep thoſe treaſures that muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily bring him to eternall confuſion?

So far from encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their pain in hell by the abuſe of them, that they have through Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy increaſed their reward in heaven, by the right uſe of them. They have built houſes for Gods worſhip. They have maintained Miniſters. They have ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Schooles. They have founded Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitals. Many other good things have they done pleaſing to God, and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the world. They have ſowne their ſeed liberally in this world, and received a plentifull harveſt in the Kingdome of heaven: They have not laid up treaſures upon earth, but ſent them before to heaven. Shall I ſay that theſe mens riches are periſhed with them? God forbid. They were rather wings to mount them toward happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ladders to clime by to a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter degree of glory.</p>

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:55313:55"/>urge them to the praiſing of God, that hath not clean refuſed them. Although he have given them a more liberall portion then others upon earth, yet hath he not deprived them of all hope of the Kingdome of heaven. Thoſe great men that have been good, have been very thankfull to God, becauſe they have perceived Gods ſpeciall love to them in their double portion. But it ſufficeth them not to acknowledge Gods bounty to them, unleſſe they make uſe of it. Their earthly portion muſt not ſatisfy them, nor make them negligent in ſeeking after an heavenly. Salvation is a matter of great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and is not attained without hard labour and much diligence: worldly wealth cannot be gotten with looking about, much leſſe can heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which is of far greater eſtimation.

<note place="margin">Joh. 1.29.</note> He is Gods Lamb, that muſt take away the Worlds ſin. Him God would not give for the Angels that were falne. Him he did give for men that had offended him. What is the reaſon why Men are more happy then Angels? Why Chriſt dyes for Men, not for Angels? Gods choiſe. And is not that the reaſon why one man rather then another ſhall be ſaved by his death? Queſtionleſſe it is ſo. When Chriſt is dead for us, how comes the merit of his paſſion to be applyed to us? We are dead in ſins, and cannot ſtretch out our hand to take it, nor open our mouth to feed on it. As men in a trance muſt have their mouths opened, and hot water put in by others: ſo muſt we have Chriſts paſſion applyed unto us by Gods Spirit. And how comes Gods Spirit to apply
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:55313:57"/>it to one ſoul and not to another, but becauſe God hath choſen the one and not the other? This kind of proceeding doth much illuſtrate the glory of God. Had God choſen all, election had been a common favour: And common fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours are lightly ſet by, when pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar priviledges are highly rated, as betokening more love in the giver, and bringing more profit to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver. If there were any thing in thoſe whom God chuſeth, more then in others, the choiſe would not tend ſo much to Gods glory as to Mans. The honour would not be the Electors, but theirs that are elected. But that favour that proceeds from pure electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, redounds altogether to the glory of the Electour. Thus is Gods glory moſt promoted by the freeneſſe of his own choiſe.</p>

And therefore he makes choiſe of the weaker. Theſe will not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend themſelves, or ſet out their own good parts, who have no wit to plot for preferment: no power nor wealth to make ſteps for a ladder to clime up upon: no nobility for which

It is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt both to themſelves and others from whence their glory comes: namely from Gods liberality in electing them. If God ſhould ſet his minde upon great men, they ſhould not ſubmit to many mean offices that God cals them unto. Their ſpirits are too great.

So that no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular reaſon can be given of Gods chuſing one man rather then another, yet there may be many grounds of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the meaner before the mighty.

No means are ever wanting unto God, who can make means: and ſuch means as we look not for, even the ſmalleſt acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents to overthrow our greateſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Their ſecreteſt plots are known to him. Their wiſeſt deſignes he can overturn by fooliſh inſtruments to their greater confuſion. Men meet with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny difficulties in cloſing with their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. They fall ſhort of them ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in power, ſometimes in policy. God is omniſcient, and omnipotent. Where he undertakes the work, all is eaſie. It proceeds with facility, which otherwiſe would prove a work of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:55313:76"/>great difficulty. Without this depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence there is no fafety to be had in the world. There is no man ſo wiſe in his own conceit, but another may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach him. There is none ſo great, but another may prove greater then he. But ſuppoſe a man that were every way both the wiſeſt and the greateſt in the world, yet were he far from a ſure e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate; becauſe he fals infinitely ſhort of Gods wiſdome and ſtrength, who can put matter enough into ſuch weak and ſimple ones, as he skorns to look upon, utterly to overthrow all his proſperity. Happy is he then, whether great or ſmall, wife or fooliſh, that depends on God alone, for he ſhall be ſafe in the fall of the mighty ones.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto we have paſſed through the the ſea of Gods election: now we are to come to the haven of Gods glory. We have heard the perſons largly deſcribed, and finde them for the moſt part to be the meaneſt. Now let us touch upon the impulſive cauſe, which might move God to make choiſe of ſuch, as it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in the concluſion of the text:

The world chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the wiſe, and refuſeth the fooliſh, takes the great, and puts by the mean, accepts the ſtrong, regards not the weak. Surely ſuch as theſe could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſo highly advanced, were it not for Gods chuſing them before greater perſonages. Where is their nobility? Where is their dexterity of apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and deepneſſe of underſtanding? Where is their martiall fortitude, and rare exploits of war? They that have theſe are refuſed: they that want theſe are received. This cannot be without an abſolute and free election. Caſt your eyes aſide now a while: look off Gods elect, and view their children. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare <hi>Iſhmael</hi> with <hi>Abraham, Eſau</hi> with <hi>Iſaac, Abſalom</hi> and <hi>Ammon</hi> with <hi>David.</hi> How unlike are theſe children to theſe parents? If their parents bad got their free dome by their ſervice, they would have pleaded the cuſtome of the City to make their children free. Their children are partakers of their nature, but not of their grace. The pureſt wheat caſt in the ground brings
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:55313:93"/>forth corn full of chaffe and darnell. He that conſiders the corn mingled with traſh, and compares it with the pure ſeed caſt into the ground, muſt needs conclude, the ſeed was not ſo clean by nature, (elſe would this have been ſo too) but it was purifyed by the ſowers labour. In like ſort he that ſees the wickedneſſe of <hi>Abſalom,</hi> and compares it with the goodneſſe of <hi>David,</hi> will be forced to confeſſe that <hi>Davids</hi> good came not from <hi>Iſhaies</hi> ſeed, but from Gods election.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, conſider the corrupt eſtate of all men by nature, and ſee if any man can come to God without election. We are the beſt of us too much cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by nature to repent of our ſelves. Gods choiſe therefore muſt make the difference. <hi>Man is a creature that wanders from his Creatour,

Theſe ſay that God hath not primarily choſen any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons, but hath choſen faith, or good works, and by conſequence thoſe whom he foreſees theſe in, thoſe he chuſeth. On the other ſide he hath rejected infidelity and wickedneſſe, and thoſe whom he foreſees theſe things in finally, thoſe he refuſeth. In a word,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:55313:100"/>he hath choſen the means, and not the perſons to the means. To theſe we may ſay as <hi>Job</hi> to his friends,

                        <hi>Ad agendum.</hi> Without action all the meditations in the world cannot aſſure us of Gods favour. For whom God loves, them doth he inſpire with the fire of good affections which flames forth into good actions. Now there are many impediments of good actions. Some lets we meet withall abroad in the world. Others we finde within in our own ſoules. All theſe muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved: and this remove cannot be done without diligence. Adde here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the manifold varieties of good actions to be done. There are duties of Piety, and duties of Sobriety, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Equity, and duties of Charity. And can all theſe duties be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diligence? No certainly, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.</p>
                     <p>Thus are we freed from Popiſh and Arminian cavils. They exclaime againſt us for teaching, that we may be aſſured of our election. They call it a doctrine of ſecurity, of liberty, and of profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. They ſay we teach men to live as they liſt, becauſe they are ſure of Gods favour. We teach men with St. <hi>Peter,</hi> that their election and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:55313:109"/>to eternall happineſſe may be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly made known to themſelves. But we teach them withall, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle doth in the text, that it cannot be done without labour and diligence. We demonſtrate to them indeed, that Gods favour cannot be loſt, for God sunchangeable. This we acquaint them with for their comfort in the world. But we ſhew them withall, that the ſenſe of Gods favour may be loſt by negligence, and then ſhall they live as uncomfortably as if they never had had it. This we do for their caution againſt the temptations of Satan and provocations of the World. Yea to make them the more carefull, we tell them, that the ſenſe of Gods favour cannot be had, nor being had cannot be kept without much labour and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <p>Look upon the rich and great men of the world.

And all this care is but for temporall riches. Wilt not thou then be more carefull to ſettle thine intereſt to eternall glory? If thou be quiet now, yet the Devill will finde a time to trie thy Evidence, and call thy title into queſtion. Sickneſſe
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:55313:111"/>and death are times of weakneſſe to thee, wherein he like a ſubtill enemy diſplayes all his art and ſtrength.

Conſider the miſery of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſons at their death. Think up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the anguiſh that their ſouls endure. They apprehend God angry with them, the Devill accuſing them, earth leaving them, heaven refuſing them, hell clayming them, ſoul and body parting, friends weeping, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves hopeleſſe, going they know not whither. What would they not give that they had made their election ſure in the time of their ſtrength, or that they might be ſtrong to do it yet? Be thou warned by their folly. Make thou all ſure beforehand. As worldly men get riches in health to cheriſh them in ſickneſſe: and as the Bees get in Summer hony to feed on, when ſtormes keep them within their hives: ſo do thou in time of health get good grounds of the aſſurance of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour that may uphold thee within againſt outward afflictions and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall temptations, when thou art ſet, as it were, between heaven and

The eye that is full of duſt can never ſee well, till it be cleanſed. The ſoul that is full of ſin, can never diſcerne it own condition, till repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance empty it. A man cannot beleeve in Chriſt for remiſſion of his ſins, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he repent of them. Much leſſe can he perſwade himſelf, that he doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve. When we endeavour to aſſure our election, we combat with Satan for eternall happineſſe.

Juſtification differs from ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, yet is it a work of our ſanctification to diſcerne our juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The unregenerate man is not juſtifyed, and therefore cannot ſee that that is not. The more full then our ſanctification is, the plainer is the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:55313:115"/>ſenſe and more comfortable the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of our juſtification. Neither is this to be done at firſt only, when we turn from wicked wayes to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, but continually in the whole courſe of our lives. The true reaſon why the conſciences of many men are not clear, is becauſe they are foul; they are not peaceable,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.1.</note> becauſe they are not pure. <hi>Davids</hi> pangs of conſcience are <hi>after he had gone into Bathſheba.</hi> The love of ſome principall corruption keeps ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny from the ſweet fruition of Gods favourable coutenance. Ranſacke thy ſoul dayly, and cleanſe away the filth of ſinne throughly by repentance, and the guilt of it will not look ſo grim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon thee to affright thy conſcience.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Faith or full confidence in Jeſus Chriſt alone is needfull to be had, without which there can be no aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of our election. Between the top and bottom of the Ladder there are certain ſteps to clime. Between electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and juſtification there muſt come faith in Jeſus Chriſt. If the ſick man forſake all the world, and leave the counſail of all his friends, and caſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the hands of ſome one Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian, he will not fail him, if he have
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:55313:115"/>any ſpark of humanity in him, becauſe his life lies in his hands. Neither will our Saviour fail them, that being ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick forſake their own merits, and all mediations of Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, deſpaire of ſalvation by any other, and truſt in him only for it. He knows not their life, but their ſoul lies in his hands alone to ſave it or condemn it. He that came to ſeek the loſt ſheep, will not refuſe the returning one. Two blind men by the way ſide cry out to our Saviour for help. The people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke them. They cry out the more. Our Saviour is ſo pleaſed with theſe loud echoes of two confident ſouls, that he cals them, gives them their choiſe, offers them any curteſie,

                        <hi>What will ye, that I ſhall do unto you?</hi> Much more will he be affected with a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſoul, that reſts on him alone for eternall life. <hi>Our fathers truſted in thee:

                     <p>Thus have I ſhewed you the way to the title.</p>
                     <p>Now for the aſſurance of the title.</p>
                     <p>The title is gotten by action, the knowledge of this title is gotten by examination. The principall notes of Gods elect muſt be known. And by them muſt we ſearch out our own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Becauſe I will not be ſo long, I will inſiſt but on a few.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The love of God in us, is a ſure token of the love of God to us. God ſcornes to be endebted to any man for his love. His affection ever goes before ours:
<note place="margin">1 Joh. 4.19.</note> 
                        <hi>We love him, becauſe he firſt loved us.</hi> I cannot certainly and infallibly tell, whether another love me, but I can certainly tell, whether I love ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:55313:116" rendition="simple:additions"/>or no. His love to me is in his heart, which I know not: My love to him is in my heart, which I know, and no creature elſe. Then may I know, that God loves me, if I know that I love him.</p>
                     <p>But it may be objected, My heart is deceitfull, and I may be deceived by it. I may think I love God, when I do not. Who lives, and thinks not he loves God, if he hear of God? Tell me therefore ſome ſure notes of the love of God in me.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, The beſt way to know our love to God, is by the properties of love.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, thoſe whom we love, we often think upon, our thoughts faſten on them when we are awake, our dreams run on them when we are aſleep. <hi>How precious are the thoughts of thee unto me O God, how great is the ſumme of them?
<note place="margin">Pſ. 139.17, 18.</note> If I ſhould count them, they are more in number then the ſand: when I am awake, I am ſtill with thee.</hi> Behold <hi>Davids</hi> love to God, ſleeping and waking his minde runs upon him. There needs no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to bring them to our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance whom we love. We neglect our ſelves to think upon them. A man
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:55313:117"/>in love waſts his ſpirits,
<note place="margin">Animus ubi amat, non ubi animat.</note> vexes his minde, neglects his meat, regards not his buſineſſe, his minde ſtill feeds on that he loves. When men love that they ſhould not, there is more need of a bridle to keep them from thinking of it, then of ſpurres to urge them to it. Try thy love of God by this. If thou thinke not often of God, thou loveſt him not. If thou canſt not ſatisfie thy ſelf with profits, pleaſures, friends and other worldly objects, but thou muſt turn other buſineſſes aſide, that thou mayeſt dayly think of God, then thou loveſt him.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, thoſe whom we love, we wil by no means be perſwaded to offend. No bands are ſo ſtrong as love. Sooner will the ſervant offend his Maſter, the ſon his father, the wife her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, the ſubiect his prince, then a friend him whom he truely loves. Friendſhip binds faſter then any au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
<note place="margin">1 Sam, 20. Gen. 39.</note> 
                        <hi>Jonathan</hi> will offend his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rather then his <hi>David. Joſeph</hi> will offend his Miſtris that dotes on him, rather then his God. Try thy love to God by this. If thou canſt eaſily ſin without any great ſenſe or ſorrow, thou loveſt not God. But if thou hadſt
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:55313:117"/>rather offend all the world then God, then thou loveſt him:</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Thoſe whom we love, we do any thing to pleaſe. Nothing can be ſo hard, but a friend will adventure on it, if he know that his friend require it, or perceive that it will be pleaſing to him. The Merchant will not run through ſo many ſtormes for gain, as a friend for love. If thou be ready to do any thing that God requires of thee, though it be never ſo croſſe to thy perverſe nature, then thou loveſt God.
<note place="margin">Gen. 22.</note> God acknowledges <hi>Abrahams</hi> love to him, becauſe he was ready to kil his ſon at Gods command. If <hi>Abraham</hi> had loved himſelf more then God, he would have kept his ſon, and not given him to God, he would have thought with himſelf, <hi>Will no meaner ſacrifice ſerve God then my Son? Will none of my cattell, nor my ſubſtance ſerve the turn?</hi> But <hi>Abraham</hi> reaſons not with fleſh and bloud, his love to God is greater then his love to his ſon. And that it might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſo, God put him in minde of his love to his ſon, <hi>Take thy ſon whom thou loveſt,</hi> that his love to God might appear to be greater: Accordingly <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhews it, and God from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:55313:118"/>pronounceth it to be greater. If thou wilt know thy love to God, be as ready to obey him.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Thoſe whom we love we can bear any thing that comes from them. We can endure their reproofs, and in ſome caſes their corrections. The child can be contented to be ſtruck by the father, that would not take a blow of another. The friend can bear a ſharp reproof of a friend, that cannot bear an harſh word from an enemy. The wife can bear with the waſpiſhneſſe of her ſick beloved hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and the husband can bear with the infirmities of his well beloved wife. Thus <hi>David</hi> ſhewed his love to God in his weakneſſe,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 39 9.</note> 
                        <hi>I was dumbe, I opened not my mouth becauſe thou didſt it.</hi> If thou fret at troubles, and look not at God, whom they come from, where is thy love to God? But if thou ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his hand, and be therefore patient, then thou loveſt God.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, Thoſe we love, we are moſt willing to endure any thing for. We are content to ſuffer for their ſakes any inconveniences.
<note place="margin">Gen. 29.20.</note> 
                        <hi>Jacob</hi> endured a tedious ſervice for <hi>Bachel;</hi> and it ſeemed but a few dayes, to him, becauſe he
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:55313:118"/>loved her. Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> loved Chriſt. He fears not the troubles foretold by <hi>Agabus.</hi> He regards not the paſſionate ſpeeches, nor affectionate tears of his friends. He loves Chriſt more then either them, or himſelf.
<note place="margin">Act. 21.13.</note> 
                        <hi>What mean ye to weep, and to break mine heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but alſo to dye at Jeruſalem for the name of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> Haſt thou St. <hi>Pauls</hi> affection to die in the cauſe of God, if the times ſhould require it? then out of queſtion thou loveſt him.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly, Thoſe whom we love, we acquaint with out miſeries, lay open our griefes to them, count it ſome eaſe to diſcharge ſome of our ſorrowes into their boſomes, their counſail we aske, and from them we look for help.

A very eaſie friend will ſerve in poſperity. If ſo ſoon as adverſity come upon thee, thou run preſently to God, and lay open all thy grief to him expecting relief only from him, then certainly thou loveſt him.</p>
                     <p>Sevently, Thoſe whom we love, we take any ſmall token wonderfull kindly from them, whereas we not only ſlight, but refuſe and ſuſpect far greater gifts, if they come from ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. The <hi>Jewes</hi> refuſed the proffered ſervice of their enemies for the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods Temple.
<note place="margin">Ezra 4.2, 3.</note> God cares not for <hi>Cains</hi> ſacrifice, becauſe he cares not for <hi>Cain.</hi> But a ſheep or lamb from <hi>Abel,</hi> whom he loves, pleaſeth the great God of heaven and earth.
<note place="margin">Gen. 4.4.</note> 
                        <hi>The Lord had reſpect unto</hi> Abel, <hi>and to his offering.</hi> A pin from a friend is more eſteemed, then a pound from an enemy. He that is thankfull to God for his meat, for his reſt, for every comfort, that God gives him, he loves God. He that eats, and drinks, and labours, and ſleeps, and never looks up to God, he loves him not at all.</p>
                     <pb n="221" facs="tcp:55313:119"/>
                     <p>Eightly and laſtly, thoſe we love having been long abſent from them, how do we long to go home unto them? How glad is the husband at the Eaſt Indies, when he may return to his dear wife, his beloved country, and his ancient friends? Me thinks I ſee <hi>Jacob</hi> triumphing at the ſight of <hi>Joſephs</hi> charriots ſent to carry him into <hi>Egypt, It is enough, Joſeph my ſon is yet alive:
<note place="margin">Gen. 45.28.</note> I will go and ſee him before I die.</hi> He that loves God, will be glad to goe to God. There is his home, there is his beſt friend. What though death be terrible for the preſent, yet the end is pleaſing. St. <hi>Paul</hi> wiſhes for it, <hi>I deſire to depart,
<note place="margin">Phil. 1.23.</note> and to be with Chriſt.</hi> What can better teſtifie thy affection to God, then thy earneſt deſire to be for ever with God? If by theſe notes well weighed, it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that thou love God, then needeſt thou make no queſtion of Gods af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection towards thee.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The love that we bear to Gods children is a ſure token of Gods love to us. The contrary is delivered as a note of the children of the Devill.
<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.10.</note> He that loveth not his brother, is not of God, but the child of the Devill. The poſſeſſion of this brotherly love is made
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:55313:120"/>an undenyable note of the heires of glory, and ſo plain a note, that they themſelves may perceive it in their own conſciences.
<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.14.</note> 
                        <hi>We know that we have paſſed from death to life, becauſe we love the brethren: he that loveth not his brother, abideth in death.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Joh. 4.7.</note> And again, <hi>Every one that loveth, is born of God:</hi> ſpoken of the love of the brethren, as appeares by the beginning of the verſe, <hi>Beloved, let us love one another.</hi> This love is not that affection, that drunkards bear one to another, becauſe they are brethren in evill. It is not that affection that Merchants bear one to another, which hath gain for the father, and hope of more for the mother. It is not that affection which children bear to their parents, for nature is their ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter, and chains of naturall affection are the bands of it. This love comes not from vice, or gain, or nature. Nay all theſe plead againſt it. Vice oppoſeth it mainly, for it oppoſeth all fellowſhip in evill. Cain cries out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, for it cuts off many occaſions of gain. Nature it ſelf ſometimes op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth it, becauſe it is above nature, and hence are the bands of naturall affection ſometimes diſunited. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:55313:120"/>ſhall be divided againſt the ſon,
<note place="margin">Luk. 12.53.</note> and the ſon againſt the father. This our Saviour foretold ſhould follow upon change of Religion. So then neither vice, nor gain, nor nature plead for this love, but the firſt ever, and the other two often againſt it. This love is a good affection to Gods children, becauſe they are Gods. None of the former reaſons perſwades us to it, but only the goodneſſe that is in them. The image of God is graven in them. And they that love God, love thoſe images of him that himſelf hath ſtamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the liker they are to God, the more they love them. The heathen did admire at that affection, that the perſecuted Chriſtians bare one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

Even they that doubt of Gods favour would give all they have if they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to God, that Chriſt would come to judgement, ſo they were ſure, that he would but acknowledge them for his own. Try then thy affection to the coming of Chriſt, and if thou finde it willing, doubt not of Gods favour.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The care of keeping a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is an undeniable prove of Gods love to us. Juſtification cannot be parted from ſanctification. But ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is more eaſily perceived, then juſtification, and by it is juſtification
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:55313:122"/>apprehended. Sanctification is a work of God in us: juſtification is a work of God concerning us. Now we do more eaſily perceive thoſe things, that are wrought in us, then thoſe that do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe belong unto us. This was St.
